I have completed Bachelors degree in Computer Science and Information Technology. During the Bachelor's degree, Some of my friends were on Web Development, At those time I had no idea what is Web Development and how all thing works. Though I always had knee interest on how to acquire those qualities in me. After classes, I would search for different fancy words that my friends had said to me that day. 

I really didn't know how things work in Web System which was the reason I would just jump to some random language and framework and touch it a bit and then leave it. It was quite a frustrating period since I didn't know what I want to do and how to get things done.

I started learning PHP which is a very popular language in web development. It was quite hard for me to learn everything at first since I had very little knowledge about database and programming language itself. After trying PHP for almost a year which was on and off learning. I was attracted toward Andriod development. I told you I was hopping around. Android Studio is one of the biggest Ram and Resource eaters of your Laptop. While learning Mobile development my whole laptop used to freeze for almost 2 minutes while building and running the code. It was so much frustrating that after starting to learn mobile development for one week I immediately uninstalled Andriod Studio and promised myself I would never do mobile development again.

Self-learning process is a hard thing. Especially when you are a beginner and you don't know what you want to do. You don't want to learn just one thing and you can't really learn everything available on the web. But it is a constant progressing thing that we shouldn't quit.

After many self-learning processes and failures, I had some realization in me that I wouldn't be able to learn things by myself. At that time I realized students like me were involved in different programs happening around in the city. I used to see that they were learning and growing through these programs but here I was failing to learn anything. At first, I was afraid to take part in any those programs because I felt I didn't know anything and all these students know so much thing, I would be so embarrassed if I take part in those programs. These thought process went for a long time. Some random thought was also there that I should participate in at least one of the program. I am still thankful for that thought that kick-started my whole learning process and somewhat kicked off my insecurities.

To Be Continued .....
